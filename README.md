# FloriPy

This is a small collection of python routines to perform overdamped dynamics of
articulated rigid bodies suspended in a viscous fluid. Hydrodynamic interaction
between the bodies is not incorporated, however there is anisotropic hydrodynamic
drag on each body.

For details on the algorithm used, please see [Dutta & Graham, Dynamics of 
Miura-patterned foldable sheets in shear flow, Soft Matter, 2017, 13,
 2620](https://doi.org/10.1039/C6SM02113A)
